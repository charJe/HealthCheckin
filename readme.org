#+title: Health Check-In
#+author: Charles Jackson

Health Check-In is a mobile application to help people at risk for generalized anxiety disorder track symptoms over time. Health Check-In is best used in conjunction with a therapist to report symptom levels with short periods of time between each report or check-in. This is done by reminding the patient to check-in every so often by rating themselves on a shortened version of the GAD-7. The can then be shared with the therapist before the next session, so the therapist can see the generalized anxiety /over time/ and detect possible triggers.
